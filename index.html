            <p>This game has been out for years and years, maybe even before you were born! This timeless game is guaranteed to take you on a journey like never before. Choose between Horde, or Alliance, and battle your opposition until the end of time. This game really does have it all, you can play the game from start to finish, solo, if you wish to. You can join groups and battle gigantic bosses and claim their epic loot. Or you can do both! There is a reason this is the most popular role playing game in the world.

            <p>This game is truly a masterpiece and one of a kind gaming experiences. Whilst the graphics aren't on the level of World of Warcraft, it makes for up for it with music that will touch your soul, battles that will get your heart racing faster than a speedtrain, and a community in which you'll likely make life long friends. Ragnarok is a perfect balance of character progression and community. Click <a target= _blank href="http://iro.ragnarokonline.com/">here</a> to find out more!</p></p>

            <p>If you haven't heard of RuneScape, I don't know what to say! This game has been around just as long as any of the other greats. The beauty about this game is, whilst the graphics aren't as good as Ragnarok or World of Warcraft. The amount of different skills/quests you can get involved in, is way ahead of the rest. You can choose to spend your days, fishing on the beach catching shark, going deep into caves looking for loot, or putting your life (and your items!) on the line, and venturing into the Wilderness, where you will lose everything if you die.

            <p>This game will always have a special place in my heart. Although the community has dwindled on the main servers, there are private servers that are still floruishing with a constant stream of new players. What seperates this game from the rest, is the player verse player. These battles would give Napolean war envy. With 180 levels to achieve, you won't be short on things to do, but be careful, if you die, it's not just your experience you lose!

            <p>An absolute classic game, what is not to love about Realm of the Mad God, a never ending stream of chat in the main towns, and a creative design to ensure you don't get bored, despite the graphics.
